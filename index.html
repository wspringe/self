Hello! I&rsquo;m <strong>Wesley Springer</strong>, an Arizona State University 2017 graduate. I&rsquo;ve had an interest in computers since using Windows 2000. Now, I&rsquo;m not someone who has been programming since before they could walk or anything, but I remember always wondering how computers work and loving to contruct K&rsquo;Nex and Lego sets. Starting ASU without an inkling of my goals and future, I thought to myself, &ldquo;I already spend much of my time on computers, why not make a living from it?&rdquo; Thus began my college experience. In my years of school I feel that the most important lessons I learned are the following three:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finding how to complete a task after identifying said task and the breakdown of that task (A.K.A. the engineering process)</li>
<li>Much information for programming is available through the internet</li>
<li>You will get frustrated &ndash; diligence and walking through your thought process is the answer</li>
</ul>

  <h1>projects</h1>
  <ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/wspringe/SogetiTrainingCampApp"><strong>Sogeti Training Camp App</strong></a><br />
This is a multi-platform app created in the React Native framework. This project was a team effort with coordination between myself and 2 others as part of our Capstone project for Arizona State University (our year-long project to finish up the C.S. degree). The purpose of this app was to create a multi-platform app (Android and iOS) that served as a guide to Sogeti&rsquo;s training camp. It uses a restful API that one of our other team members created to connect to a back end for POSTing and PUTting to the restful API. Basically, our app parsed JSON from the API and displayed it on the front end. For this project, I was solely responsible for learning React Native and using Javascript (and JSX) to create the front end of the app and connect it to the back end using the API. I was also responsible for managing the repository on GitHub using git.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/wspringe/Twitter-Reviews-App-iOS"><strong>Twitter Reviews App for iOS</strong></a><br />
App made for final project of mobile apps development class.
Incoporates Fabric&rsquo;s TwitterKit to pull review from Twitter&rsquo;s search API. User can place a pin on the map, name the pin whatever they want, and perform a WebView Google search of the name and/or a Twitter search for Tweets containg that name.
The plan was for users to mark restaraunts on the map, and be able to search for that restaraunt for Twitter reviews or a Google search all from within the app. However, no Heuristic Analysis is performed on the contents of the Tweets, so the Tweets could be about anything. Also, the app does not consider locale or language of the Tweets.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/wspringe/War"><strong>War</strong></a><br />
A recreation of a simple card game I played as a kid. A deck is shuffled, and two players each get half the deck. Then, each player plays one card at a time. The card with the higher value wins the round and takes both the cards. The player with the most cards when both the decks are empty, wins. Made with C++ to mostly learn git and GitHub.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/wspringe/Hacking-Linux"><strong>Custom Syscall</strong></a><br />
Recreating the &lsquo;ps -e&rsquo; syscall in Linux. Part of learning Linux and learning how to create syscalls and modules. Made in C.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/wspringe/TSA-Randomizer"><strong>TSA Randomizer</strong></a><br />
Practice with making Androids apps. The app will randomly point left or right when tapped.</p></li>
